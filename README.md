# NOTICE

For a while the UK COVID-19 figures have been available primarily via an API that I have neglected for a while. I was going to fix this by using this API instead of the CSV downloads, but quite frankly I can't be bothered. No-one is even aware that this repo exists anyway, and I'm sure there are better projects on here that do just the same (maybe even more) - this was just a lockdown project anyway to kill time.

----------

# COVIDTracker-2
An updated version of my first COVIDTracker python app.

# Usage
Simply run the script and check the **graphs** folder located in the directory that the script resides in.

```
python3 -u main.py
```

# Prerequisites
Please see requirements.txt located in this repository.
These should be installed using ``` pip3 ``` or another Python package manager.
